This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Example of ggplot

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=cars, aes(x=speed, y=dist)) + geom_point()
```

My project :

I try to open the csv file of my (little) experiment :

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df <- read.csv("~/Documents/M2/stage/experiments/build/test.csv", header = T);
ggplot(data=df, aes(x=nb.of.monomials, y=nb.layers)) + geom_point()
```
